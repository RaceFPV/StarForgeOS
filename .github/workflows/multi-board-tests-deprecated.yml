# ⚠️ DEPRECATED - Use build-validation.yml instead
#
# This workflow is being replaced by build-validation.yml for better efficiency.
# It currently duplicates build.yml and wastes Actions minutes.
#
# To replace this workflow:
# 1. Delete this file: .github/workflows/multi-board-tests.yml
# 2. Use build-validation.yml for PR validation (fast, ~3 min)
# 3. Use build.yml for full builds (comprehensive, ~20 min)
#
# See STRATEGY.md for details on the optimized CI/CD approach.
