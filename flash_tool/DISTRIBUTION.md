# StarForge Flasher - Distribution Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start for Users

### Download Pre-built Installers

Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/RaceFPV/StarForgeOS/releases/latest) and download:

- **macOS**: `StarForge-Flasher-1.0.0.dmg` (~35-40MB)
- **Windows**: `StarForge-Flasher-Setup-1.0.0.exe` (~40-50MB)

### Installation

**macOS:**
1. Download the `.dmg` file
2. Open it and drag "StarForge Flasher" to Applications
3. Launch from Applications (first time: Right-click → Open to bypass Gatekeeper)

**Windows:**
1. Download the `.exe` file
2. Run the installer
3. Launch from Start Menu or Desktop

### Usage

1. **Connect your ESP32** via USB
2. **Launch the app** - it will auto-detect your board
3. **Click "Flash Firmware"** - downloads latest firmware automatically
4. **Wait for completion** - don't disconnect!

That's it! No Python, no command line, no technical knowledge required.

## 🛠️ Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/RaceFPV/StarForgeOS.git
cd StarForgeOS/flash_tool

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Download esptool binaries (required for building)
./download-esptool.sh

# Build for your platform
npm run build          # Current platform
npm run build:mac      # macOS only
npm run build:win      # Windows only
npm run build:all      # Both platforms
```

Output will be in `flash_tool/dist/`:
- macOS: `.dmg` and `.zip`
- Windows: `.exe` installer

### Development Mode

```bash
npm start
```

This launches the app without building an installer.

## 🤖 Automated Builds (GitHub Actions)

The flasher is automatically built for every release via GitHub Actions.

### How It Works

1. **Push a tag** or **create a release** on GitHub
2. GitHub Actions automatically:
   - Builds firmware for all ESP32 boards (existing workflow)
   - Builds flasher apps for macOS and Windows (new workflow)
   - Uploads all assets to the release
3. Users download and install - zero configuration needed

### What Gets Built

Each release includes:
- **Firmware ZIPs**: 8 board types
  - `StarForge-esp32-c3-supermini.zip`
  - `StarForge-esp32-c3.zip`
  - `StarForge-esp32-c6.zip`
  - `StarForge-esp32dev.zip`
  - `StarForge-esp32-s3.zip`
  - `StarForge-esp32-s3-touch.zip`
  - `StarForge-esp32-s2.zip`
  - `StarForge-jc2432w328c.zip`

- **Flasher Apps**: 2 platforms (new)
  - `StarForge-Flasher-1.0.0.dmg` (macOS)
  - `StarForge-Flasher-Setup-1.0.0.exe` (Windows)

### Trigger a Build

```bash
# Create and push a tag
git tag v1.0.1
git push origin v1.0.1

# Or create a release via GitHub UI
# Go to: https://github.com/RaceFPV/StarForgeOS/releases/new
```

## 📦 What's Included

The flasher app is **completely self-contained**:

✅ **esptool binaries** - No Python installation needed  
✅ **All dependencies** - No npm or Node.js needed  
✅ **Serial drivers** - Works out of the box (on most systems)  
✅ **GitHub integration** - Auto-downloads firmware from releases  
✅ **Offline mode** - Can flash from local firmware folder  

Users literally just download, install, and flash. That's it!

## 🎯 File Sizes

- **DMG (macOS)**: ~35-40MB
- **EXE (Windows)**: ~40-50MB

Why so large?
- Electron framework (~30MB)
- esptool binaries (~15MB for all platforms)
- Node.js runtime (bundled)
- Chromium rendering engine (bundled)

This is normal for Electron apps and ensures everything works out of the box.

## 🔐 Code Signing (Optional but Recommended)

For production releases, you should sign your apps:

### macOS
Requires an Apple Developer account ($99/year):
```bash
export CSC_LINK=/path/to/certificate.p12
export CSC_KEY_PASSWORD=your_password
npm run build:mac
```

### Windows
Requires a code signing certificate:
```bash
export CSC_LINK=/path/to/certificate.pfx
export CSC_KEY_PASSWORD=your_password
npm run build:win
```

Without signing:
- **macOS**: Users will see "unidentified developer" warning
- **Windows**: SmartScreen warning on first run

Both can be bypassed by users, but signing provides a better experience.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Builds

### Build fails on macOS
```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
rm -rf dist node_modules
npm install
npm run build:mac
```

### Build fails on Windows
```cmd
rmdir /s /q dist node_modules
npm install
npm run build:win
```

### esptool missing
```bash
cd flash_tool
./download-esptool.sh
```

### Can't build Windows on Mac
This should work, but if it fails:
- Use a Windows machine or VM
- Or use GitHub Actions (it will build both platforms)

## 📝 Version Numbers

Update version in `flash_tool/package.json`:
```json

```

This version appears in:
- Installer filename
- App "About" dialog
